Unfortunately, many drivers make common mistakes that can keep their cars from running at peak performance. Here are some common car maintenance mistakes and tips to help you avoid them so you can keep your car running safely and efficiently.</p>\n<h2>Don't Ignore Regular Maintenance</h2>\n<p>It's important to stay on top of regular maintenance to keep your car running in top condition. Most car manufacturers have a recommended maintenance schedule that outlines when you should have specific services done, such as oil changes and tire rotations. By sticking to the recommended schedule, you can help keep your car running smoothly and catch any issues before they become major problems.</p>\n<h2>Check Your Tires</h2>\n<p>Your tires are an important part of keeping your car safe to drive. Make sure to check the tire pressure regularly with a reliable pressure gauge and keep the tires inflated to the correct level. You should also inspect your tires for any damage or signs of wear and tear. If you find any issues, it's important to get them fixed as soon as possible.</p>\n<h2>Change Your Oil Regularly</h2>\n<p>Regular oil changes are key to keeping your engine running smoothly. Changing your oil helps keep dirt and contaminants out of your engine and ensures that parts are lubricated properly. It's important to follow the manufacturer's recommended interval for oil changes, which is usually every 5,000 to 7,500 miles.</p>\n<h2>Stay On Top Of Fluids</h2>\n<p>It's also important to check your car's other fluid levels regularly and keep them topped up. This includes the coolant, brake fluid, transmission fluid and power steering fluid. Checking your fluids can help you catch any issues before they become serious problems and can help you keep your car running efficiently.</p>\n<h2>Turn off Electronic Devices</h2>\n<p>Electronic devices can drain your car battery, so it's important to turn off any devices you may have connected or to disconnect them before you turn off the car. This includes cell phones, tablets, MP3 players, wireless headphones and anything else that may be connected. This will help you make sure your car has enough battery to start every time.</p>\n<h2>Look For Warning Signs</h2>\n<p>Always keep an eye out for warning signs that your car may need maintenance. This includes a decrease in fuel efficiency, excessive exhaust smoke, grinding or whining noises, a shaky idle and any strange smells or sensations when the car is running. If you notice any of these warning signs, it's important to get the car serviced as soon as possible.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>By avoiding these common car maintenance mistakes, you can help keep your car running smoothly and safely. Remember to stay on top of regular maintenance, check your tires, change your oil regularly, top up your car's other fluids, turn off electronic devices and be on the lookout for warning signs that may indicate a problem. Following these tips will help you prevent breakdowns and keep your car running efficiently.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Avoiding Common Car Maintenance Mistakes","date":"January 31, 2023","description":"This article provides an in-depth look at iPhone 6s Plus features and design, including explanations of the A9 chip, 3D Touch, 4K video recording, and much more.
