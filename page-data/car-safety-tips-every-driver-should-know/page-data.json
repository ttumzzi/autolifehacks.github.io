Scan your surroundings for road debris, pedestrians, and cyclists and be sure to check for vehicle non-responsiveness and recklessness. Also, be aware of sharp turns, inclines, and other curves – all of which can affect your visibility and require additional caution. If it’s raining or snowing, use extra caution and slow down.</p>\n<h2>Check Your Vehicle’s Glazing and Lights</h2>\n<p>Take a few moments to check the condition of your vehicle’s glazing and lights before you drive. Make sure all windows and your windshield are free from dirt, grime, and haze. Headlights, taillights, and brake lights should be working properly and in-tact for safe and efficient night driving. A quick and easy way to check your lights is to back up to a wall and look at your reflection.</p>\n<h2>Know the Rules of the Road</h2>\n<p>It’s important to stay up to date on your local and state rules of the road. Knowing when and where to speed, brake, and turn is essential for safe driving. Also, keeping an eye out for signs is important. If you are unclear of a traffic sign, slow down and ask another driver, pedestrian, or cyclist.</p>\n<h2>Make Sure You Have the Right Accessories</h2>\n<p>Having the right accessories makes a big difference in how you drive and can potentially save your life. Make sure you have the right seat belt, lights, mirrors, turn signals, brakes, and tires. Seat belts are the most important accessory and can prevent accidents in the event of a collision. Additionally, make sure to keep an emergency kit in the trunk of your car that includes a flashlight, flares, and a first aid kit.</p>\n<h2>Watch Your Blind Spots</h2>\n<p>It’s important to adjust your mirrors and scan for blind spots before making a move on the road. Be aware of cars in your blind spots during lane changes and turns. Also, check for other cars before merging onto highways, and double-check for cars in your blind spots when backing out of parking spots.</p>\n<h2>Keep Your Phone Out of Sight</h2>\n<p>It is illegal in many states to use your cell phone while driving, so it’s important to keep your phone out of sight and out of reach. A great way to avoid the temptation of using your phone while driving is to store it in a glove box or to disconnect it from bluetooth hands-free.</p>\n<h2>Watch Your Road Habits</h2>\n<p>You want to form safe driving habits that make you a better and more experienced driver over time. Don’t follow too close to other cars and practice defensive driving. When possible, allow other vehicles to go first and maintain a steady speed. Be mindful of your speed around curves and never tailgate.</p>\n<p>By following these car safety tips, you can become a more cautious and responsible driver and ensure the safety of yourself and other drivers on the road.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Car Safety Tips Every Driver Should Know","date":"January 31, 2023","description":"This article takes a look at the increasing popularity of cricket in the United States, particularly among immigrants.
