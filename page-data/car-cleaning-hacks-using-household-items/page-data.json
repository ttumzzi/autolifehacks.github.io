But since time, effort, and money are all things we would like to avoid, who said that cleaning your car had to involve all three? Keep your car looking shiny with these car cleaning hacks which use household items that can easily be obtained.</p>\n<h2>WD-40</h2>\n<p>WD-40 is a must-have for any car owner who wants an easy and effective way to make their car look great in no time. WD-40 can help clean dirt, grime, and mud off of car door panels, making them look new and clean. It can also be used to remove bugs from the front of your car and help get rid of the grease and grease stains on the hood and fenders.</p>\n<h2>White Vinegar</h2>\n<p>White vinegar can be used as an effective cleaner for headlights to get rid of the yellow tint. Just fill a bucket or spray bottle with vinegar and spray it onto the headlights and within minutes, your headlights will be crystal clear.</p>\n<h2>Baking Soda</h2>\n<p>Baking soda is excellent for removing burnt-on gunk from the engine bay. One cup baking soda and a small amount of dish soap made into a paste and applied to the engine bay can help loosen and remove any dirt and grime from the engine. It works like a charm.</p>\n<h2>Toothpaste</h2>\n<p>Toothpaste is a great way to clean the interior and exterior of your car. It can be used to remove signs of wear and tear from the dashboard and car doors. Simply rub a dab of toothpaste onto the spots and let it sit overnight. In the morning, wipe the spot with a damp cloth and your car will look as good as new.</p>\n<h2>Limes</h2>\n<p>Limes, or any type of citrus fruits, have abrasive properties that can be used to lightly scour the interior or exterior of your car. The acidity of the fruits helps get rid of scuffs and scratches. You can even use lemon or lime slices to remove tough dirt stains or marks from the paint.</p>\n<h2>Shaving Cream</h2>\n<p>Shaving cream is a great cleaner for the cloth seats in your car. Apply some evenly over the spots and let it sit for a few minutes. After that, use a wet sponge to wipe away the dirt and excess cream. The seats will look good as new.</p>\n<h2>WD-40 and Newspaper</h2>\n<p>This combo can be used to shine up the windows of your car. To make them sparkle, spray the windows with a generous amount of WD-40 and immediately wipe the windows down with crumpled up newspaper. The windows will be smudge- and streak-free.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>With these simple car cleaning hacks, it’s easy to keep your car in incredible condition with very little effort.
