On average, it is recommended to change your oil every 5,000 miles, and if it's not changed regularly, your car is not able to optimize its fuel efficiency. Not only that, but it will cause your engine to last shorter, and have to be replaced faster - making it a less efficient investment long term.</p>\n<p>Different car types and engines require different types of oil. Many petrol engines require 5W-30 during the winter (thicker oil for colder months, thinner for hotter months). It's best to consult your car manual, or speak with a trusted mechanic to determine the best oil for your vehicle.</p>\n<h5>Tip 2: Keep Tires Inflated at the Correct Pressure</h5>\n<p>Tires can effect your gas mileage drastically. Tires that are either over-inflated or under-inflated will cause your car to have to work harder, and therefore less efficiently. Your car manual will have the correct pressure listed for the type of vehicle you are driving. It is best to check your tire pressure every other week, and to account for pressure drops or increases due to temperature changes. You can also invest in a Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) that will keep track of your tire pressure for you.</p>\n<h5>Tip 3: Don't Be Overweight</h5>\n<p>An easy trick that can have a big effect on your car's efficiency is to not be overweight when driving. In other words, if you are carrying a lot of items in your car, you are weighing it down, making it harder for the engine to move the car forward, thus reducing its fuel efficiency. To maximize fuel efficiency, try to clean out your car periodically, removing any excess items that you don't need.</p>\n<h5>Tip 4: Choose The Right Grade Of Fuel</h5>\n<p>Another important factor in determining your car's fuel efficiency is the grade of fuel you use. Most modern cars are designed to run on the unleaded, 87 octane fuel. Higher octanes will likely just waste money, as they are typically unnecessary for standard engines. Make sure to always use the right octane in order to optimize your fuel efficiency.</p>\n<h5>Tip 5: Avoid Stop-And-Go Driving</h5>\n<p>Finally, another easy trick you can apply to get more from your gas tank is to avoid stop-and-go driving. This type of driving is when you stop and start frequently, like driving in rush hour traffic. This cycle of starting and stopping puts a lot of stress on your engine, and will cause you to use a lot more gas. Whenever possible, try to plan your trips so that you can avoid stop-and-go driving.</p>\n<p>By following these simple tips, you can do your part to make sure your car is as fuel efficient as possible, and save a good amount of money on gas.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"5 Simple Tricks for More Efficient Gas Mileage","date":"January 31, 2023","description":"This article is about community-based intervention methods for addressing mental health issues.
