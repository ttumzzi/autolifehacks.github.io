Whether you are unsure of your next steps in life or simply seeking clarity about what it is that you want, fear of the unknown can be paralyzing. With that in mind, here are 7 life hacks to get you through the 'undefined' and into the future.</p>\n<h2>1. Acknowledge Your Anxiety</h2>\n<p>The first and perhaps the most important life hack to remember when faced with 'undefined' is to acknowledge your anxiety. It is natural and normal to feel fearful or apprehensive when faced with the unknown, and it is important to practice self-care and allow yourself to feel your emotions. Taking time to identify your thoughts and emotions can help you gain a better understanding of the root of those feelings.</p>\n<h2>2. Commit to Self-Reflection</h2>\n<p>Taking the time to thoroughly self-reflect is a powerful life hack for dealing with 'undefined'. Taking a step back to gain perspective can help you gain clarity and new perspectives on the issue at hand. This can be done through writing, talking to others, meditating, or even doing art. Taking the time to reflect can help ease the anxiety and gives you a better understanding on how best to approach the situation.</p>\n<h2>3. Take Ownership of Your Life</h2>\n<p>It is easy to become bogged down in the feeling of powerlessness when faced with uncertainty; however, the truth is, you have the power to create your own destiny. Taking ownership of your life and understanding that you have the power to make decisions about your life is key to moving forward in an 'undefined' situation.</p>\n<h2>4. Avoid Overthinking</h2>\n<p>Your brain has a tendency to turn on overdrive when you face an 'undefined' situation. It can be easy to overthink and spiral into thoughts that lead to fear, worry, and uncertainty. It is natural for your thoughts to wander, but it is important to keep yourself grounded and remember that overthinking can lead nowhere. Instead, ground yourself and stay present in the moment.</p>\n<h2>5. Do Something With Your Hands</h2>\n<p>When feeling overwhelmed by an 'undefined' situation, it can be immensely helpful to redirect your energy into something more productive. Doing something with your hands can help take your mind off of the problem and provide an outlet for your anxious energy. Something such as gardening, creating art, painting, cooking, or simply tidying up can be immensely helpful in this regard.</p>\n<h2>6. Find Something To Look Forward To</h2>\n<p>When feeling overwhelmed by 'undefined', it can be immensely helpful to find something to look forward to. This can be anything from something small such as a cup of coffee or something larger like a weekend away. Having something to look forward to can help lift your spirits and put you in a better frame of mind.</p>\n<h2>7. Take A Cognitive Break</h2>\n<p>Finally, taking a cognitive break can be a powerful life hack for dealing with the stress of 'undefined'. Taking a break from thinking or worrying can provide a much-needed respite from the frenzy of your thoughts. This can be done by taking a walk, engaging in an enjoyable activity, or by engaging in mindfulness.</p>\n<p>The feeling of 'undefined' can be a confusing and stressful one.
