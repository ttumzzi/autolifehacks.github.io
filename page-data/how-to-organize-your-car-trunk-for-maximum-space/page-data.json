If there’s just one big space to deal with, little items can get lost and forgotten. To stay organized, you can buy or make compartments to help separate your items. Separating your items into containers can help you keep track of what items you have, what you don’t have and where you put them. You can purchase or make a few containers and install them in the trunk.</p>\n<h2>Utilize a trunk organizer</h2>\n<p>Another great way to stay organized is to have a trunk organizer. This is a great tool to help keep your items separate and find what you’re looking for quickly. Trunk organizers come in different shapes and sizes and can be used to store anything from groceries to sporting goods. It also allows you to maximize the space in your trunk by resting items in compartments or shelves.</p>\n<h2>Invest in magnetic strips</h2>\n<p>If you’re looking for an easy-to-reach spot to store items such as flat screwdrivers, hobby knives, or scissors, you should consider adding a magnetic strip to your trunk. This can help save your trunk space and create easy access points to the small items you usually carry. With just a few magnets, you can stick any item you need quickly onto the strip and have access to it without rummaging through the compartments or drawers.</p>\n<h2>Hang a shoe organizer</h2>\n<p>Shoes can take up a lot of space in your trunk, as well as in your vehicle. To save space, you can hang a shoe organizer on the back of the seats to store your shoes. This is perfect for anyone who likes to keep their shoes tidy and within reach. You can use it to store flip-flops for summer trips or heavy boots for winter ones.
