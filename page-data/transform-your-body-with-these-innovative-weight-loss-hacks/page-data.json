It could be a project, a relationship, a goal, a task or practically anything else. Not knowing how to proceed and feeling paralysed, you put off dealing with the undefined for far too long. In such instances, it can be incredibly hard to take the first steps and make progress on the undefined.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, there are certain strategies and life hacks you can adopt that can make tackling an undefined task considerably easier. In this blog we look at 6 such life hacks and strategies, to help control – and eventually conquer – the undefined.</p>\n<h2>Planning and Prioritizing</h2>\n<p>The first step when faced with the undefined is to sit down and start planning what it is you need to do and why. Is there an end goal in sight? Is there a deadline? What resources will you need to achieve the end goal? All these questions and more need to be answered as your first step.</p>\n<p>Once you have an understanding of the task and what goals needs to be achieved, you can decide on how to prioritize them. By prioritizing and separating the tasks, you'll be able to focus and move ahead with the most important and urgent ones first.</p>\n<h2>Breaking it down into achievable and manageable pieces</h2>\n<p>If the prospect of tackling the undefined is daunting, you can break it down into smaller, achievable pieces. No task is too big if made into smaller, more manageable chunks. It's like the saying \"How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time.\"</p>\n<p>One way to break a task into manageable pieces is to create a checklist. Once that is done, you can start ticking off items on the list, one at a time. This will help you focus on the most pressing tasks without being distracted.</p>\n<h2>Create smaller, realistic goals</h2>\n<p>When you are dealing with the undefined, it is important to create smaller, realistic goals. Thinking of achieving the end result all in one go, can often be overwhelming. But if you create smaller, more achievable targets that you can work towards, you’ll be able to make steady progress towards the end result.</p>\n<p>Smaller goals can also be beneficial for motivation purposes. Achieving smaller goals can be a huge morale boost and often it's these accomplishments that give you the resilience to move on and succeed.</p>\n<h2>Take small breaks</h2>\n<p>When you are working with something undefined and have set yourself goals, it can be easy to get lost in your work and not take any breaks. But it is important to take occasional breaks. This gives you a period of refreshment that you need to clear your mind and feel rejuvenated.</p>\n<p>No matter how busy you are, make sure to incorporate small breaks in your day. Take a walk, have a cup of coffee or even set short time-limits on tasks like \"I'm going to work on this for 45 minutes and then take a break\" and then stick to it.</p>\n<h2>Involve others</h2>\n<p>When dealing with the undefined, you don't have to perform this task alone. If you are struggling for motivation or if you need help with completing the tasks, don't be afraid to involve others too.</p>\n<p>Talking to people about a project or a topic can often be incredibly helpful. You'll learn from the experience of others, and quite possibly come up with new ideas to help you get the job done.</p>\n<h2>Don’t be afraid</h2>\n<p>Finally, the most important trait when it comes to tackling the undefined is having the courage to start. Don't be afraid of facing the unknown, be daring and take calculated risks.</p>\n<p>Unknown terrain can often lead to unforeseen opportunities and experiences that you wouldn't have had if you hadn't been bold and taken the first steps.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>When it comes to dealing with the undefined, the most important thing is to never lose sight of the task at hand and stay motivated. Have a plan, break it into manageable tasks, set realistic goals, take short breaks and don't be afraid of involving other people. Follow these life hacks and strategies and you'll soon find yourself far along the journey of conquering the undefined.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Transform Your Body with These Innovative Weight Loss Hacks","date":"February 01, 2023","description":"is an article written by a certified personal trainer that provides helpful tips and tricks on how to successfully lose weight and keep it off.
